# Advent of Python code

This is a repo for my Advent of Code solutions in Python. 
I started with the 2018 as a way to learn Python which I
had not used before. I only made it to day 10 before the
real event for 2019 began so there is where I continued.  
  
The tasks can be found at:  
[Advent of Code 2019](http://adventofcode.com/2019/)  
[Advent of Code 2018](http://adventofcode.com/2018/)  
  
I try to keep the solutions as simple as possible since it 
just needs to work and AoC is a competition. If I have the time 
I do try to tidy them up after both tasks are solved and fix 
 obviously stupid things i have done. However, Python is not my
native language at the moment. I have surely failed to use 
language features that could have made the solutions 
even more straight forward. Hopefully i discover them on the way.
