# Advent of Python code

This is a repo for my Advent of Code solutions in Python. 
I started with the 2018 as a way to learn Python which I
had not used before. I only made it to day 10 before the
real event for 2019 began so there is where I continued.  
  
The tasks can be found at:  
[Advent of Code 2019](http://adventofcode.com/2019/)  
[Advent of Code 2018](http://adventofcode.com/2018/)  
  
I try to keep the solutions as simple as possible, but if
I have time I try to tidy them up after both tasks are solved, 
it is a competition.
